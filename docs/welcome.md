## Introduction

**Web3API** is a developer tool that allows easy integration of Web3 protocols into any application. It makes it possible for applications on any platform, written in any language, to read and write data to Web3 protocols.

:::tip
Web3API is in **pre-alpha**, meaning our code and documentation are rapidly changing. We have support for Linux and Mac OS, but you may experience issues on Windows.

**Web3API** is a developer toolchain that makes it easy to interact with any blockchain (or P2P network) from any programming language!

:::caution

Web3API is in **pre-alpha**, meaning our code and documentation are rapidly changing. Have questions or want to get involved? Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Z5m88a5qWu) or [open an issue](https://github.com/Web3-API/monorepo/issues) on our GitHub repo.

### **Getting started**

We know software docs can be overwhelming, especially for something as technical as a developer toolchain. That's why we've made this guide user-friendly for anyone interested in Web3API, whether you're a non-techie or an experienced programmer.

### **For: The Casually Interested Reader**

If you're interested in understanding Web3API at a high-level, we recommend watching [this introductory video on our website](https://web3api.dev). No deep technical knowledge required.

If after that you're still wanting more, check out this deeper dive from our [ETH Denver presentation](https://youtu.be/9HhB4XL4AR4). This presentation not only covers the tech, but also the ecosystem that's helping make Web3API a reality!

If you'd like to see Web3API in action, check out our [SimpleStorage on Ethereum demo](/demos/simplestorage-eth).

### **For: Developers**

If you're a developer interested in building with Web3API, we recommend [starting here](/developers/start-here).

It introduces you to Web3API through a technical lens, explaining how it works at a high level, and the many benefits it brings. From there you'll be directed to one of our development guides, where you'll build something that fits your use-case (dApp, Web3API, Plugin).

If you'd like to see Web3API in action, check out our [SimpleStorage demo](/demos/simplestorage-eth).

### **For: Technical Specification Information**

If you're looking for the most low-level details of how Web3API works, you've come to the right place!

Head over the our [specification repository](https://github.com/Web3-API/specification) (still very WIP) to get a look at how the standard functions, regardless of what language you're using Web3API in.

You definitely don't need to go through this material in order to build Web3APIs or dApps using Web3API. However it is quite useful to shine some light on the black boxes that exist when using new frameworks.

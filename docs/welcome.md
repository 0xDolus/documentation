## Introduction

**Polywrap** is a developer tool that enables easy integration of Web3 protocols into any application. It makes it possible for applications on any platform, written in any language, to read and write data to Web3 protocols.

:::tip
Polywrap is a rebrand of Web3API and the toolchain code libraries are still under the Web3API name. Regardless, you can still get started building with Polywrap and we'll update the names of these libraries very soon!

Polywrap is in **pre-alpha**, meaning our code and documentation are rapidly changing.
